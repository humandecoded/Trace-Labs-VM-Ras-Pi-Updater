# Trace-Labs-VM-Ras-Pi-Updater

This repo will contain the files necessary for updating the raspberry pi port of the Trace Labs VM. A script on the pi will reach out here to check for changes and then run these updates on itself.

Firefox has a habit of overwriting the OSINT Bookmarks. This repo contains an up to date back up and will be moved to the Desktop of the Kali Pi system.
